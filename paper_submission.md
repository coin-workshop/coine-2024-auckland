# Paper Submission

### Instructions for Authors

For preparation of papers please follow the instructions for authors available at the Springer LNCS Web page. 

We solicit three types of papers in the [LNCS format](https://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines):
- Full research papers (16 pages, excluding references)
- Short research papers (10 pages, excluding references) – These 'early-innovation' papers are work-in-progress papers and these will be reviewed with an emphasis on novelty/originality of the idea.
- Blue sky ideas (up to 16 pages, excluding references) – These papers have the same scope of the blue sky ideas track of AAMAS 2023 (see [https://aamas2023.soton.ac.uk/calls/blue-sky-ideas/](https://aamas2023.soton.ac.uk/calls/blue-sky-ideas/)), focussing on the COINE topics

All papers must be written in English and submitted in PDF format. __*Information about the paper type should be included at the end of the title of the paper – (Full), (Short) or (Blue Sky ideas).*__

For submission of papers, please use the EasyChair site at: [https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=coine2023](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=coine2023)

Submitted papers will be reviewed on a "single-blind" basis by at least two reviewers.

Submission of a paper should be regarded as an undertaking that, should the paper be accepted, at least one of the authors will attend the workshop to present the work.

### Proceedings

Preliminary proceedings will be available before the conference. They will also be distributed to AAMAS 2023 registrants in electronic form.

As with previous COIN(E) workshops, COINE intends to publish post-proceedings in Springer's LNCS series (pending confirmation). Authors will be invited to submit revised and extended versions of their paper for consideration in these post-proceedings.

Revised papers must take into account the discussion held during the workshop; hence, only papers that are presented during the workshop will be considered for inclusion in the post-proceedings volume.
