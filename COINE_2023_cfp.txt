CALL FOR PAPERS

************************************************************************************
International Workshop on Coordination, Organizations, Institutions, 
Norms and Ethics for Governance of Multi-Agent Systems (COINE), 
co-located with AAMAS 2023
************************************************************************************

COINE 2023 is co-located with the International Conference on Autonomous Agents and
Multiagent Systems (AAMAS), London, United Kingdom, 29 May-2 June 2023 (https://aamas2023.soton.ac.uk/)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Overview
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The pervasiveness of "open systems" raises a range of challenges and
opportunities for technologies in the area of autonomous agents and
multi-agent systems. However, achieving and maintaining a "good" society
is difficult because the autonomy of the agents (including human
participants) can work against the effectiveness of the society.
The goal of the workshop is to bring together researchers in autonomous
agents and multi-agent systems working on the scientific and technological
aspects of social coordination, organizational theory, normative MAS,
artificial or electronic institutions, norm/policy-aware and ethical agents.


Coordination, organizations, institutions, norms and ethics are five key 
governance elements for the regulation of open multi-agent systems. This 
workshop is an evolution of the COIN (Coordination, Organizations, 
Institutions and Norms in Agent Systems) workshop series that ran at 
various conferences including AAMAS (13 times), IJCAI, AAAI and ECAI
since 2006 (see Workshop Series Website), and produced 13 volumes of 
post-proceedings in Springer’s Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence.

Continuing this tradition, the goal of the COINE workshop is to bring 
together researchers in autonomous agents and multi-agent systems 
working on the scientific and technological aspects of social 
coordination, organizational theory, normative MAS, artificial or 
electronic institutions, norm-aware and ethical agents.

We invite submissions that address any of the following aspects:

     - mathematical, logical, computational, philosophical and pragmatic 
issues related to COINE;
     - modelling, animation and simulation techniques for open MAS;
     - tools, prototypes and working systems;
     - experimental investigation of the effectiveness of COINE 
technologies;
     - challenging or innovative ideas relevant to the field;
     - methodologies for the development of trustworthy AI; and
     -  trustworthy AI education within the scope of MAS.

The workshop complements the main AAMAS program by allowing a more 
relaxed and in-depth discussion of MAS from a social perspective and has 
proven to be an event that encourages debate, and fosters collaboration 
among researchers in these topics.

A specific emphasis of this year’s iteration of COINE lies on the 
response to growing interest in the concept of norms applied to social 
and human-centric AI, so we will also aim to establish better mutual 
awareness between COINE and that community by making explicit references 
in our scope for research in development methodologies and education of 
trustworthy AI.

To leverage a broader understanding on how COINE-related themes are 
employed in these research disciplines, we will invite established 
researchers from the respective fields in order to highlight their 
perspectives on and adoption of COINE theory and technologies. Building 
on those insights, we will use this workshop to provide a platform to 
discuss the potentially varying viewpoints and facilitate the 
exploration of synergies as well as collaborative opportunities across 
community boundaries.

COINE inherited COIN’s B-rating on the Computing Research and Education 
Association of Australasia (CORE) conference ranking list 
http://portal.core.edu.au/conf-ranks/2160/. COIN holds a B4 rating by 
the Qualis ranking from CAPES (Brazil).

Instructions for Authors
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

For preparation of papers please follow the instructions for authors 
available at the Springer LNCS Web page. 

We solicit three types of papers in the LNCS format (https://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines):
• Full research papers (16 pages)
• Short research papers (10 pages) – These 'early-innovation' papers are work-in-progress papers and these will be reviewed with an emphasis on novelty/originality of the idea.
• Blue sky ideas (up to 16 pages) – These papers have the same scope of the blue sky ideas track of AAMAS 2023 (see https://aamas2023.soton.ac.uk/calls/blue-sky-ideas/), focussing on the COINE topics

The page lengths mentioned above include figures and references. All papers must be written in English and submitted in PDF format. Information about the paper type should be included at the end of the title of the paper – (Full), (Short) or (Blue Sky ideas).

For submission of papers, please use the EasyChair site at:
~~https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=coine2022~~

https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=coine2023

Submitted papers will be reviewed on a "single-blind" basis by at least two reviewers.

Submission of a paper should be regarded as an undertaking that, should 
the paper be accepted, at least one of the authors will attend the 
workshop to present the work.

Proceedings
-----------
Preliminary proceedings will be available before the conference. They 
will also be distributed to AAMAS 2023 registrants in electronic form.

As with previous COIN(E) workshops, COINE will publish post-proceedings 
in Springer’s LNCS series. Authors will be invited to submit revised and 
extended versions of their paper for consideration in these 
post-proceedings.
