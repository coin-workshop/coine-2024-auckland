This COINE edition will be hosted by [AAMAS 2024 (The 23rd International Conference on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems)](https://www.aamas2024-conference.auckland.ac.nz){:target="_blank"}, which will take place in Auckland, New Zealand on May 6-10, 2024. This workshop is one of the 11 areas of interest for AAMAS. It complements the AAMAS main program by allowing a more relaxed and focused discussion of MAS from a social perspective. Previous editions of COINE have proven to foster collaboration among researchers in the relevant topics.

# Objectives

Coordination, organizations, institutions, norms and ethics are five key governance elements for the regulation of open MAS. The goal of the workshop is to bring together researchers in autonomous agents and multi-agent systems working on the scientific and technological aspects of social coordination, organizational theory, normative MAS, artificial or electronic institutions, norm/policy-aware and ethical agents.

The pervasiveness of "open systems" raises a range of challenges and opportunities for developing technologies in the area of autonomous agents and multi-agent systems (MAS). In open MAS, artificial and human autonomous agents, their modes of interaction and the pursued goal of the system may change over time. Additionally, the autonomy of the agents, which can be influenced and amplified by coordination techniques, can work against the effectiveness of the system. The success of these systems relies on effective governance to maintain an equilibrium between the autonomy of the (artificial and human) agents and the predictability of the system. Hence, there is a need for methods, techniques, mechanisms and tools that are able to balance the equilibrium between these two forces to make the system mode effective in attaining its purposeful goals.

The COINE workshop (see [COIN Series Website](https://www2.pcs.usp.br/~coin/){:target="_blank"}) is an evolution of the COIN (Coordination, Organizations, Institutions and Norms in Agent Systems) workshop series that ran at various conferences and produced 16 volumes of post-proceedings in Springer's Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence (see [COIN Series Proceedings](https://www2.pcs.usp.br/~coin/coin_springer.html){:target="_blank"}).
