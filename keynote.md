### Value Aware Multiagent Systems

**Abstract**: Norms have extensively been used as means of governing multiagent behaviour. But with the rise of hybrid human-AI societies, the need to consider the alignment with human values has gained tremendous traction lately, giving rise to the value-alignment problem. The value-alignment problem is defined as the problem of designing systems that are provably aligned with human values. To achieve this, there is a need to develop software systems that reason about both human values and norms, implement these values through norms, and ensure the alignment of behaviour with those values and norms. The result would be value aware systems that take value-aligned decisions, interpret human and agent behaviour in terms of values, and even enrich human reasoning by enhancing the human's value-awareness.
